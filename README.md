# The-Moving-CD
I made this small music-player project where a CD spins whenever the song is playing and stops spinning when the music is paused. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the whole thing. The main idea was to make a circular CD that rotates using CSS animation, and then control that animation using JavaScript based on whether the audio is playing or paused.
